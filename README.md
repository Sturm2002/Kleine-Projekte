**SpaceInvaders_In_Console.py / 417 lines **:
yeahh.. actually it's not quite SpaceInvaders, but it's getting close, and realllly buggy, i just don't care anymore

**SpaceInvaders.py / 278 lines **:
pretty much the same, but in a GUI

**pong.py / 267 lines **:
retro pong, but worse and in a console

**MineSweeper_In_Console.py / 256 lines  **:
Name says it all, controls are up, down, left, right, space to discover and c to set a flag, alt+f4 to rage quit,

**Pong_In_Console.py / 204 lines **:
Guess what... exactly, the old retro game pong, inside of a console

**snake.py / 185 lines **:

A Graphical Demonstration of "Josephus' Problem", see https://youtu.be/uCsD3ZGzMgE

**Databank_personen.py / 127 lines **:
totally useless diy database management tool, i literally made it when i was like 15 cause i was totally pissed at my teacher,
because i got a bad grade in Computer Science because i didn't learn Microsoft Access, so i made my own database like tool or something like that.
Still didn't get a better grade, so it was totally wasted time, probably like all of this

**literallyafuckingbutton.py / 41 lines **:

**Loost_PY / 1300 lines **:
ok, so that one is actually pretty cool and i'm still kinda proud about it, it's a kind of "text adventure" all in a console (yeah i really like consoles(not the game console type but the terminal type you know ?)) you have a map, inventory, equipable items,  some potions, enemys and a battle system, it's fucking sick, try it out, but check for librarys like colorama, just look up what got imported, if you can't code you probably wouldn't be here, so you probably should be able to figure it out, have fun
PS: the xp system doesn't really work as far as i know, and will never, also discontinued, got bored

**Pong_VB / 752 lines**:
also pong, i like to code it, it's simple but always improvable, it actually had sounds (maybe even still got it? ) but i used absolute paths so they won't work on your machine, you can get it to work though.
 
**TikTakToe_CS / 302 lines **:
do i even have to write something, i think everybody knows what it is, if you don't it's your problem
 
**Dungeon_Knights_2_PY / ? lines, too lazy to count all together **:
canceled it's bullshit

**DoppelKlatschen_Digital_Edition_PY / 158 lines **:
a diy game i made with my friends, it's actually a card game based on a german card/drinking game called "Klatschen", our edition is just wayyy dirtier, "harder" and funnier

**GuessTheNum_CS / 60 lines **:
